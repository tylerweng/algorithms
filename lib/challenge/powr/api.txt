Due to the added constraint of only tracking a hit as being from
a distinct IP address once every 10 days, the simplest way to implement
the POWr Hit Counter would be to store key-value pairs in a database
where the key is the IP address and the value is a stack of the timestamps
created when the user visited the site. A timestamp would be added to
the stack if and only if the stack is empty or it is greater than 10
days after the timestamp at the top of stack. This would allow us to
track the number of hits by iterating through the keys in our database
and returning the sum of our stacks' lengths.

If we were to create this counter on a high traffic site, one way we
could optimize our space is instead of storing key-value pairs for all
possible IP address, we kept track of a count of total visitors and
a database (as described above) that only keeps track of visitors from
the last 10 days. Since the only constraint upon unique hits is to store
a hit from a user once per 10 days, we would use that database to check
against the user. If that user's IP address exists in our database, it
means they have visited our site within the last 10 days, so we don't
update our database and we don't increment our count, else we do.
