Sanjay runs a team of 22 members
Most of it in Russia, build 3 major product lines for Nominum, involved in
integrations for the full product (not those 3 products in particular)

Integration is a lot of interaction w/ customer, combination of being diligent and
technical with the client. Integrations don't come along everyday
Enterprise focused (ups and downs, not a steady stream of integrations)

Still doing coding and code reviews, more of a technical hand for the Russia
team, who needs help, they are very productive if you can get them the right
answers, but if Sanjay fails to find them the right answers that day, then they
look for that person (what I'm applying for) to fill in that hole.

Take over vs being a helping-hand; initially can hand-hold, but want the person to pick it up and run with it. It's not rocket science, there are some boundaries.

Skill part of it
- Spring
- TOMCAT
- RESTful
- C++
- Linux

Understanding DNS, protocols, C++, have to understand the underlying stuff,
not necessarily have to code inside it to communicate with the platform team

Moved to DNS cache servers (from some other server stuff)
When u enter a url and hit enter, the first thing it hits is the
DNS cache servers (speed mission critical)
2 million queries / second
As an individual user, the amount of time it takes for server and ISP to handle
my response, the DNS cache server takes care of that
What Nominum does along with that is built a platform and application
that goes on top of that, say security, or parental control (like
no one in my house can browse drugs), have a whole suite that categories
websites (like drug websites, weapons, etc.)

This can be applied to both individual users and to businesses (e.g.
Starbucks)

Security another big feature (say a bug on my computer that is trying
to reach out to a website, we don't let the bug go off (although
we don't fix it either))

A lot of companies have tried to "skin the cat" in various ways,
Nominum's solution is unique in that they don't skin the cat, they apply
categories to things

Also messaging, places like Latin America which are majority pre-paid
(unlike here, mostly post-paid), we have a way to send notifications
saying "You almost used up your 2 gb of data, here's your options"

Try to not be super intrusive, so no ads, but stick to ISP's basic needs
Some people want to use it for ads, but that's a different ball game,
Sanjay doesn't want to go down that path

Upselling because they are not able to upsell, also customer satisfaction

But if you got a message, it's like "oh they care about me"

Looking at "adding upsale value"
