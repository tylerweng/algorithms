## Location: Los Angeles

## Interviewer: Brett

When he started, there were only like 8 people in the tech team total, including CTO and solution architect. Since then (9 mths ago),
the engineering team has doubled and so has the company as a whole

Engineering team is split into smaller teams to hash out features
As you approach a problem, half-way defining a spec as you go
Expect engineers to take ownership of features

# Product Features

- Managing workflow
- Automating reconciliations (here are the places where things aren't
tying out)

# Engineer Team

Now Two Pods: 17 engineers total, split into two

Largely autonomous

Moving away from one monolith to independent services

More pods, at least 3 pods by end of year

Max size: probably 10 in a pod, but ideally maybe 5 ppl

Control over a certain domain w/in an application, devs to shift
between pods

# Schedule
Multi-hour sprint planning at start of sprint
Daily standup
2 week sprints
Highly value reviewing code not just writing new code  
Get code ready for QA team
